/* MTFI 1.21: iface.h
/*
/* This file is a part of the INTERFACE.  That means that, if you want
/* to port this program or write a new user interface, you SHOULD modify
/* this file.  See below for how.
/*
/* This file contains the things which the interface needs to tell the
/* core at compile time.  You can put declarations for interface-
/* specific functions in this file without harm, but this isn't really
/* the appropriate place.
/*
/* This file is automatically included at the appropriate place from
/* mtfi.h; it should not be included seperately.  (Specifically, mtfi.h
/* includes the file after it has declared all the structure types and
/* defined fdat but before it has defined the structures.)
/*
/*     This code is Copyright 1998 Ben Olmstead.  Distribute according
/* to the GNU Copyleft (see the file COPYING in the archive from which
/* this file was pulled).  Considering the coding standards that the FSF
/* demands for anything written for them, this probably is making them
/* have fits, but then, FSF code looks like trash, even if it is easy to
/* understand.
